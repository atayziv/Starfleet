# Starfleet
In this project I built a software system for managing a futuristic spaceship fleet.
Initially, I built classes that represented the crew members and the various types of spacecraft using weapons, abstract classes and inheritance. 
After that, I created objects of these classes and finally printed several reports showing different slices of information about my spaceship fleet:
such as total maintenance cost, total firepower of the fleet spaceships and more.
